This is a C# program.

Brief history:
I love watching anime but it consumes a lot of time. Most of the time an anime has more than one hundred episodes. Each episode is about 25 minutes including a *what has happened until now* flashback, intro and outro.
Since I like watching it a lot but I don't have much time I decided to make a program that tells me how much time I need for watching 23 episodes for example. 
I can calculate it but since I'm lazy, I preffer writing a codeblock that will calculate it for me.

*
How it works:
This program does not calculate the actual time of an entire episode. It calculates only the good stuff. 
The flashback, intro and outro are cut-off from the calculations. Without them it's about 20 minutes. So I assume that 1 episode is 20 minutes.
The rest is programming logic.
